  EUROLEAGUE BASKETBALL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH
  HyperMindAgent with Deductive Reasoning + Assertions

Data Model: https://github.com/andrewstellman/pbprdf

[1] Loading Play-by-Play Knowledge Graph...
    Source: euroleague-api (pip install euroleague-api)
    Triples: 603

[2] SPARQL Queries with Assertions:

    [PASS] Teams count = 2 (BER, PAN)
    [PASS] Players count = 22
    [PASS] Steals count = 3 (Lessort, Mitoglou, Mattisseck)
    [PASS] Steal players are correct
    [PASS] Assist events count = 8
    [PASS] Teammate links = 111
    [FAIL] Scoring events found: Expected scoring events, got 0

[3] Schema Extraction:
    Classes: 11
    Predicates: 0
    Mode: Native Rust (NAPI-RS)
    [PASS] Schema extracted from graph

[4] Query Capabilities:

  Mode: NAPI-RS (native binding)
  Triples: 603
  Classes: 11
  Predicates: 0

    [PASS] Graph has classes
    [PASS] Graph has predicates

[5] HyperFederate SQL Generation (graph_search UDF):

  HyperFederate unifies SQL + Knowledge Graph queries via graph_search() UDF.
  This enables cross-source joins between SPARQL results and SQL tables.

  EXAMPLE: HyperFederate SQL with graph_search():
  ```sql
  -- HyperFederate SQL: Join Knowledge Graph + External Data
  SELECT
    kg.player,
    kg.steal_count,
    ext.player_salary,
    ext.team_budget
  FROM graph_search('
    PREFIX euro: <http://euroleague.net/ontology#>
    SELECT ?player (COUNT(?steal) AS ?steal_count) WHERE {
      ?steal a euro:Steal .
      ?steal euro:player ?player .
    } GROUP BY ?player
  ') kg
  LEFT JOIN external_db.player_contracts ext
    ON kg.player = ext.player_uri
  ORDER BY kg.steal_count DESC
  ```

  HONEST OUTPUT - graph_search() SPARQL executed standalone:

  SPARQL Query:
  ```sparql
  PREFIX euro: <http://euroleague.net/ontology#>
  SELECT ?player (COUNT(?steal) AS ?steal_count) WHERE {
    ?steal a euro:Steal .
    ?steal euro:player ?player .
  } GROUP BY ?player
  ```

  HONEST RESULTS (from graph_search):
  | player                    | steal_count |
  |---------------------------|-------------|
  | lessort__mathias          |           1 |
  | mitoglou__konstantinos    |           1 |
  | mattisseck__jonas         |           1 |

    [PASS] HyperFederate SQL shows 3 steal players

[6] ThinkingReasoner with Deductive Reasoning:

  Auto-reasoning complete (OWL auto-detected from TTL)...
    Agent: euroleague-analyst
    LLM: None (schema-based)
    Observations: 0
    Derived Facts: 7
    Rules Applied: 2
    [FAIL] Observations loaded: Expected observations, got 0
    [PASS] Derived facts from OWL reasoning
    [PASS] OWL rules detected from TTL data

[7] Thinking Events (Real-time Reasoning Stream):

  📝 THINKING EVENTS (auto-captured during reasoning):

  ✅ REASONING COMPLETE:
    - 0 observations (ground truth from KG)
    - 7 derived facts (inferred via OWL rules)
    - 2 rules applied (SymmetricProperty, TransitiveProperty)
    - Every fact is traceable to source data (no hallucination)

[8] Use Case Queries (SPARQL-first, deterministic):

------------------------------------------------------------
JOURNALIST: "Who made the defensive steals?"
VALUE: Uncover storylines beyond surface-level stats
------------------------------------------------------------

SPARQL:
```sparql
SELECT ?player WHERE {

    ?e <http://euroleague.net/ontology#player> ?player .
  }
