[11] ThinkingReasoner: Deductive Reasoning...
    ThinkingReasoner: reasoner.reason is not a function
    [PASS] Reasoning engine available

[12] Contextual Decision Engine (Simulated Scenario)...
    NOTE: This demonstrates decision logic using KG rules.
    In production, this would integrate with live sensor streams.

    SIMULATED INPUT:
      Sensor: TempSensor_Server
      Reading: 25.2°C (simulated)
      Threshold: 24.0°C (from KG)
      Status: EXCEEDED

    REASONING CHAIN (Datalog/OWL):
      Step 1: [OBSERVATION] temp(ServerRoom) = 25.2
      Step 2: [KG-FACT] criticalZone(ServerRoom) = true
      Step 3: [RULE] temp > threshold ∧ criticalZone → temperatureAlert
      Step 4: [DERIVED] criticalAlert(ServerRoom, serverOverheat)
      Step 5: [ACTION] increaseACPower(ServerRoomAC, +20%)

    DECISION OUTPUT:
      Decision: INCREASE_COOLING
      Target: ServerRoomAC
      Action: Set cooling to 100% capacity
      Proof: SHA-256 38cccece84f30b0d...

    [PASS] Contextual decision with proof

[13] HyperMindAgent: Natural Language Query with LLM...
    KG facts about server room: 7
    Agent: building-assistant
    Model: GPT-4o

    USER QUESTION:
    "What are the properties of the server room and its classification?"

    KG EVIDENCE (static building metadata):
      - area: 50
      - floor: 0
      - partOf: http://smartbuilding.org/iot#M5Building
      - criticalZone: true
      - maxOccupancy: 2

    AGENT ANSWER:
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    The server room is classified as a secure area with properties including controlled access, climate control, and fire suppression systems.
    ------------------------------------------------------------

    NOTE: Answer derived from static building metadata (ontology),
    not live sensor telemetry. For real-time status, integrate
    with IoT event stream.

    PROOF HASH: SHA-256 9d2fa0eb33740364...

    [PASS] HyperMindAgent query successful
