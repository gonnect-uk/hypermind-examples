[5] HyperFederate SQL Generation (graph_search UDF):

  HyperFederate unifies SQL + Knowledge Graph queries via graph_search() UDF.
  This enables cross-source joins between SPARQL results and SQL tables.

  EXAMPLE: HyperFederate SQL with graph_search():
  ```sql
  -- HyperFederate SQL: Join Legal Knowledge Graph + Court Records
  SELECT
    kg.attorney_name,
    kg.role,
    kg.case_name,
    westlaw.citation_count,
    westlaw.career_wins,
    lexis.bar_admission_year
  FROM graph_search('
    PREFIX law: <http://law.gov/case#>
    SELECT ?attorney_name ?role ?case_name WHERE {
      ?case a law:Case .
      ?case rdfs:label ?case_name .
      ?case law:arguedBy ?attorney .
