    [PASS] Neighborhoods count = 10
    [PASS] Properties count = 18
    [PASS] Property types count = 4 (SingleFamily, Condo, MultiFamily, Commercial)

[5] HyperFederate SQL Generation (graph_search UDF):

  HyperFederate unifies SQL + Knowledge Graph queries via graph_search() UDF.
  This enables cross-source joins between SPARQL results and SQL tables.

  EXAMPLE: HyperFederate SQL with graph_search():
  ```sql
  -- HyperFederate SQL: Join Knowledge Graph + External Property Data
  SELECT
    kg.address,
    kg.assessed_value,
    kg.neighborhood,
    mls.listing_price,
    mls.days_on_market,
    (mls.listing_price - kg.assessed_value) AS price_premium
  FROM graph_search('
    PREFIX prop: <http://boston.gov/property#>
    SELECT ?address ?assessed_value ?neighborhood WHERE {
      ?p a prop:Property .
      ?p prop:address ?address .
      ?p prop:assessedValue ?assessed_value .
      ?p prop:locatedIn ?n .
      ?n rdfs:label ?neighborhood .
    }
  ') kg
  LEFT JOIN mls_listings mls
    ON kg.address = mls.property_address
  WHERE kg.assessed_value > 1000000
  ORDER BY price_premium DESC
  ```

  HONEST OUTPUT - graph_search() SPARQL executed standalone:

  HONEST RESULTS (from graph_search):
  | address                           | assessed_value | neighborhood    |
  |-----------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
  | 165 Marlborough Street            |     $2,850,000 | Back Bay        |
