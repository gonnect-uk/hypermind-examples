## Overview

This demo implements a semantic music recommendation engine using patterns from MusicBrainz and Wikidata. It demonstrates:

- Artist influence networks with transitive reasoning
- Genre taxonomy with parent/related relationships
- Collaborative filtering via graph analytics
- Explainable recommendations with derivation chains

## Data Model

### Artist Ontology

```turtle
@prefix music: <http://music.org/> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .

# Artist influence is transitive
music:influencedBy a owl:TransitiveProperty .

# Artist with rich metadata
music:LedZeppelin a music:Artist ;
    music:name "Led Zeppelin" ;
    music:formed "1968"^^xsd:gYear ;
    music:genre music:HardRock, music:BluesRock ;
    music:influencedBy music:BluesBreaers, music:Cream ;
    music:influenced music:GnR, music:Aerosmith .
```

### Genre Taxonomy

```turtle
# Genre hierarchy
music:Metal a music:Genre ;
    music:parentGenre music:Rock ;
    music:relatedGenre music:HardRock .

music:ThrashMetal a music:Genre ;
    music:parentGenre music:Metal ;
    music:tempo "fast" .
```

### User Profiles

```turtle
music:User_Alice a music:User ;
    music:listened music:LedZeppelin, music:PinkFloyd ;
    music:preferredGenre music:ProgressiveRock ;
    music:listenCount "247"^^xsd:integer .
```

## Datalog Rules

### Genre-Based Recommendations

```prolog
% Recommend artists in same genre
genreRecommendation(?user, ?artist) :-
    preferredGenre(?user, ?genre),
    genre(?artist, ?genre),
    not(listened(?user, ?artist)).
```

### Influence-Based Recommendations

```prolog
% Recommend influential artists (transitive)
influenceRecommendation(?user, ?artist) :-
    listened(?user, ?likedArtist),
    influencedBy(?likedArtist, ?artist),
    not(listened(?user, ?artist)).

% Also recommend artists they influenced
influenceRecommendation(?user, ?artist) :-
    listened(?user, ?likedArtist),
    influenced(?likedArtist, ?artist),
    not(listened(?user, ?artist)).
```

### Collaborative Filtering

```prolog
% Users with similar taste
similarUser(?user1, ?user2) :-
    listened(?user1, ?artist),
    listened(?user2, ?artist),
    notEqual(?user1, ?user2).

% Recommend what similar users like
collaborativeRecommendation(?user, ?artist) :-
    similarUser(?user, ?similar),
    listened(?similar, ?artist),
    not(listened(?user, ?artist)).
```

## HyperMindAgent Interactions (LLM-Powered)

The HyperMindAgent provides natural language music discovery powered by GPT-4o or Claude. Below are real interactions from local execution:

### Interaction Table

| User Query | LLM Answer | Knowledge Source | Reasoning |
|------------|------------|------------------|-----------|
| "I love Led Zeppelin and Metallica. What similar artists should I listen to and why?" | "You might enjoy listening to Guns N' Roses, as they are influenced by The Beatles, who also influenced Metallica. Additionally, exploring genres like Progressive Rock and Art Rock, which are related to the music styles of Led Zeppelin, could introduce you to similar artists." | SPARQL on `music:influencedBy`, `music:relatedGenre` | Agent traversed influence network to find common influences (Beatles → Metallica), then used genre relationships (Progressive Rock ↔ Art Rock) to expand recommendations |

### Sample Agent Output

```
[15] HyperMindAgent: Natural Language Query with LLM...
    Agent: music-advisor
    Model: GPT-4o

    USER QUESTION:
    "I love Led Zeppelin and Metallica. What similar artists should I listen to and why?"

    AGENT ANSWER:
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    You might enjoy listening to Guns N' Roses, as they are influenced
    by The Beatles, who also influenced Metallica. Additionally, exploring
    genres like Progressive Rock and Art Rock, which are related to the
    music styles of Led Zeppelin, could introduce you to similar artists.
    ------------------------------------------------------------

    PROOF HASH: [SHA-256 verification]

    [PASS] HyperMindAgent query successful
```

### How It Works

1. **User Question** → Natural language music preference
2. **Schema Extraction** → Agent reads ontology (genre, influencedBy, relatedGenre)
3. **SPARQL Generation** → LLM generates queries for influence chains and genre relations
4. **Query Execution** → rust-kgdb executes against music knowledge graph
5. **Answer Synthesis** → LLM provides recommendations with explanations
6. **Proof Hash** → Cryptographic verification of reasoning chain

### Recommendation Logic

The agent combines multiple strategies:
- **Influence-based**: Find artists who influenced or were influenced by favorites
- **Genre-based**: Find artists in same or related genres
- **Transitive reasoning**: Follow OWL TransitiveProperty chains (A influenced B, B influenced C → A influenced C)
- **Symmetric relationships**: Use OWL SymmetricProperty for bidirectional genre relations
